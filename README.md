- üé® **Modern UI**: Clean, responsive interface with sample questions

## üíæ Data Structure

The agent draws from structured data in Supabase:

```
dean_profile/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ cv_profile          # Basic info, experience, skills, projects
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ work_insights        # Problem-solving approach, values, communication style
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ supporting_docs      # Blog posts, code documentation, personal reflections
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ self_reflection      # Energy sources, collaboration preferences, growth areas
```

## üß™ Sample Questions & Expected Responses

| Question | Mode | Expected Response Style |
|----------|------|------------------------|
| "What kind of engineer are you?" | Default | "I'm an AI Robotics Engineer who specializes in bridging embedded systems with modern AI automation..." |
| "What are your strongest skills?" | Interview | Concise, achievement-focused list with measurable outcomes |
| "Tell me about your PocketQube project" | Storytelling | Detailed narrative with context, challenges, and lessons learned |
| "Quick facts about your experience" | Fast Facts | Bullet-point summary of key highlights |

### 3. UI Deployment  

Deployed using bolt.new platform

## ü§ñ AI Collaboration Artifacts

### AI Agents Used
1. **Claude (Anthropic)** - System architecture and n8n workflow design, content structuring and prompt engineering
2. **bolt.new** - React component development and JavaScript logic
3. **GPT-4** - Content structuring and prompt engineering

### Prompt Engineering Evolution

**Initial Prompt** (too generic):
```
"You are an AI assistant that answers questions about Dean"
```

**Final Prompt** (context-aware):
```
"You are Dean Jeggels' Personal AI Assistant. Answer questions about Dean in first person using data from the Supabase database. Always query the database first, then respond in Dean's authentic voice with specific examples..."
```

> **Note**: All system prompts can be found within the JSON n8n workflow above. These were generated with help of giving context to Claude (Anthropic) model sonnet 4.0 thinking.

### AI-Generated vs Manual Code

| Component | AI Generated | Manual Edits | Notes |
|-----------|-------------|--------------|--------|
| React UI Structure | 90% | 10% | bolt.new generated base, manual styling tweaks |
| n8n Workflow Logic | 20% | 80% | Claude designed prompts and code, manual n8n configuration |
| System Prompts | 90% | 10% | GPT-4 prompt engineering with minor personality adjustments |
| SQL Data Structure | 60% | 40% | AI suggested schema, manual data organization |

## üìà What I'd Improve With More Time

### Technical Enhancements
- **Vector Search**: Implement semantic search for more relevant context retrieval
- **Conversation Memory**: Persistent chat history across sessions  
- **Analytics Dashboard**: Track question patterns and response effectiveness
- **Multi-modal Support**: Add voice input/output capabilities

### Content Enhancements  
- **Dynamic Learning**: API endpoints to add new experiences and projects
- **Social Proof**: Integration with LinkedIn/GitHub for real-time updates
- **Interactive Examples**: Embedded code snippets and project demos

### Production Features
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevent API abuse
- **Authentication**: User sessions and personalized experiences
- **Monitoring**: Response quality analytics and error tracking
