# Dean Jeggels - Personal Codex Agent

A context-aware AI agent that authentically represents Dean Jeggels, built using n8n workflows, Supabase RAG, and a modern React interface.

## 🎯 Project Overview

This Personal Codex Agent answers questions about Dean's professional background, technical skills, projects, and work philosophy using real data extracted from his CV and supporting documents. It demonstrates AI-native development practices and structured data handling.

## 🏗️ System Architecture

[React UI] → [Webhook] → [n8n Workflow] → [Supabase RAG] → [OpenAI GPT-o4mini] → [Webhook Response] → [Answer in UI]  

### Design Choices

1. **n8n for Orchestration**: Chosen for visual workflow management and built-in integrations
2. **Supabase as RAG Database**: Provides structured JSON storage with powerful querying capabilities  
3. **React UI with Mode Switcher**: Demonstrates different conversation personalities
4. **OpenAI GPT-o4mini**: Latest model for nuanced, contextual responses

## 🚀 Features

### Core Functionality
- ✅ Context-aware responses using real CV and project data
- ✅ RAG implementation with Supabase database
- ✅ Authentic voice representation speaking as Dean
- ✅ Real-time conversation through webhook integration

### Bonus Features  
- 🎭 **5 Conversation Modes**: Interview, Storytelling, Fast Facts, Humble Brag, Self-Reflection
- 🧠 **Self-Reflective Responses**: "What energizes/drains me?", "How do I collaborate best?"
- 📊 **Structured Data Architecture**: Organized CV and supporting document insights
- 🎨 **Modern UI**: Clean, responsive interface with sample questions

## 💾 Data Structure

The agent draws from structured data in Supabase:

dean_profile/
├── cv_profile # Basic info, experience, skills, projects
├── work_insights # Problem-solving approach, values, communication style
├── supporting_docs # Blog posts, code documentation, personal reflections
└── self_reflection # Energy sources, collaboration preferences, growth areas


## 🧪 Sample Questions & Expected Responses

| Question | Mode | Expected Response Style |
|----------|------|------------------------|
| "What kind of engineer are you?" | Default | "I'm an AI Robotics Engineer who specializes in bridging embedded systems with modern AI automation..." |
| "What are your strongest skills?" | Interview | Concise, achievement-focused list with measurable outcomes |
| "Tell me about your PocketQube project" | Storytelling | Detailed narrative with context, challenges, and lessons learned |
| "Quick facts about your experience" | Fast Facts | Bullet-point summary of key highlights |
| "What makes you stand out?" | Humble Brag | Confident presentation of unique achievements |
| "What kind of work energizes you?" | Self-Reflection | Thoughtful insights about motivation and collaboration |

## 🔧 Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- n8n instance (cloud or self-hosted)
- Supabase account with database access
- OpenAI API key
- Node.js for UI development

### 1. Database Setup
-- Run the provided SQL scripts to create tables and insert data
CREATE TABLE dean_profile (
id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
section VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
data JSONB NOT NULL,
created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);
-- [Insert statements provided in setup files]


### 2. n8n Workflow Import
1. Import the provided workflow JSON into your n8n instance
2. Configure credentials for Supabase and OpenAI
3. Update webhook URL in the UI configuration

### 3. UI Deployment  
npm install
npm run build
npm run deploy


## 🤖 AI Collaboration Artifacts

### AI Agents Used
1. **Claude (Anthropic)** - System architecture and n8n workflow design
2. **GitHub Copilot** - React component development and JavaScript logic
3. **GPT-4** - Content structuring and prompt engineering

### Prompt Engineering Evolution

**Initial Prompt** (too generic):
"You are an AI assistant that answers questions about Dean"


**Final Prompt** (context-aware):
"You are Dean Jeggels' Personal AI Assistant. Answer questions about Dean in first person using data from the Supabase database. Always query the database first, then respond in Dean's authentic voice with specific examples..."


### AI-Generated vs Manual Code

| Component | AI Generated | Manual Edits | Notes |
|-----------|-------------|--------------|--------|
| React UI Structure | 80% | 20% | Copilot generated base, manual styling tweaks |
| n8n Workflow Logic | 60% | 40% | Claude designed architecture, manual n8n configuration |
| System Prompts | 90% | 10% | GPT-4 prompt engineering with minor personality adjustments |
| SQL Data Structure | 50% | 50% | AI suggested schema, manual data organization |

### Conversation Logs
Me: "How should I structure the mode switcher in the UI?"
Copilot: [Generated complete React component with useState hooks]
Me: "Add loading states and better error handling"
Copilot: [Enhanced with loading animations and try/catch blocks]
Final: Manual styling adjustments and UX improvements

## 📈 What I'd Improve With More Time

### Technical Enhancements
- **Vector Search**: Implement semantic search for more relevant context retrieval
- **Conversation Memory**: Persistent chat history across sessions  
- **Analytics Dashboard**: Track question patterns and response effectiveness
- **Multi-modal Support**: Add voice input/output capabilities

### Content Enhancements  
- **Dynamic Learning**: API endpoints to add new experiences and projects
- **Social Proof**: Integration with LinkedIn/GitHub for real-time updates
- **Interactive Examples**: Embedded code snippets and project demos

### Production Features
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevent API abuse
- **Authentication**: User sessions and personalized experiences
- **Monitoring**: Response quality analytics and error tracking
